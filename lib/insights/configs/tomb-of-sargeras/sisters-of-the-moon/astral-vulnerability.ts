the raid takes damage from {ability:234998:Astral Purge:spellshadow},
and gains a stack of {abilityTooltips}
(which increases the damage taken from {ability:234998:Astral Purge:spellshadow}).
{abilityTooltips} expires after 2 seconds.
To minimise raid damage, raids often cross the line in groups of 5 or less players.
Take care not to stand on the line or to strafe back and forth across it.
Be wary in melee-heavy compositions, where a large proportion of the raid will necessarily be clumped up.
Melee can split into two groups, and should be careful not to follow the boss across the line unnecessarily,
even if the tanks move them out of range.`
